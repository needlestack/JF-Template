Echo Tests....

There's not a lot you can test about an echo:

Test1: test1 Test2: test2 Test3: test3
test4test5

Test2: Oh, you can test that the variable names work with dots:
	foo bar

Test3: And you can test that malformed  give a proper warning.

Test4: But do malformed tags with a  give a proper warning?
